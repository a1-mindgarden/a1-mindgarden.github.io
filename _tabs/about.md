In this second semester of my third year and until the first semester of the next academic year, we will be having a *Capstone Project and Research* course. The main objective of this course is to apply all IT knowledge into one final project and do a study on how that project benefits the involved parties. We are given the power to decide on what niche we are going to focus on, e.g. IoT or mobile, desktop, or web application, or game, etc. To get started, we are randomly grouped into three to four members. We are then tasked to identify five (5) possible project titles that our group sees as innovative **AND** achievable within the time frame and budget. From the five titles, we ranked them from what we really wanted to less wanted to implement. With that said, the group’s most wanted title will be presented to the panelists to seek approval.

## The present

Fast-forward to now, thankfully, our most wanted title, entitled **“Mind Garden – Gamified Mental Wellness Tracker with Anonymous Peer Support”**, was approved.

## What is this project all about?

### The Gamified Side

To elaborate on the idea of the gamified side, here's an app the idea was inspired on:

 [**Forest: Focus for Productivity**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.forestapp&pcampaignid=web_share)


<div style="display: flex; gap: 20px;" markdown=1>

But, instead of tracking focus and trees, we will be tracking mental wellness activities and garden plants. For every self-care activities, users will receive growth points for their plant. Accumulating these growth points can help the plant to fully grow, which will then be transferred onto their virtual garden.

### Anonymous Peer Support

Think of a chat app where your identity is hidden where you can express your thoughts and feelings freely to your peers.
